# analog hi-hat

I spent quite some time looking for a hi-hat that I liked. I wanted a bit more
than little bursts of white noise. So I found the [following thread on the
look-mum-no-computer
forum](https://lookmumnocomputer.discourse.group/t/dr-110-hi-hat-clone/4248)
about the DR-110 hihat. All credits go to 'saint_et_moudulard' for designing
this circuit. The circuit mixes 4 square-waves made using a CD40106 with white
noise and generates little bursts of this sound when triggered.

I designed my own stripboard layout to make a compact module.
