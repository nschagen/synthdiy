# Synth-diy

In this repository, I'm keeping track of the materials I'm using/creating for
my modular synthesizer. This includes adaptations of schematics, stripboard
layouts, panel designs and random notes.

A lot of the schematics and stripboard layouts are not designed by me but are
adaptations of work done by others. I would like to thank the kind people below
